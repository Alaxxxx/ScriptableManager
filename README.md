A comprehensive Unity Editor tool for managing, organizing, and analyzing ScriptableObjects in your project with advanced features and an intuitive interface.


## ‚ú® Features

The tool is built around three core pillars: Organization, Workflow Integration, and Deep Analysis.

### üóÇÔ∏è Organization & Management
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Instantly find any asset by name or `ScriptableObject` type.
- **Favorites System**: Bookmark your most-used assets for one-click access.
- **Recently Modified**: A dedicated view to track and access recently changed assets.
- **Smart Sorting**: Flexible sorting options by name, type, or modification date.
- **Statistics Panel**: Get a high-level overview of your project's `ScriptableObject` usage and type distribution.

### ‚ö° Workflow & Integration
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Drag assets directly from the manager to any Inspector field.
- **Multi-Selection**: Use `Ctrl` to select multiple assets for batch operations (delete, add/remove from favorites).
- **Rich Preview Panel**: See detailed asset information with thumbnails, metadata, and a preview of the object's data.
- **Customizable Settings**: Configure excluded paths to keep your workspace clean and relevant.

### üîé Analysis & Insights
- **Dependency Analysis**: A powerful two-way view to see what each asset **Uses** (dependencies) and what it is **Used By** (referencers).
- **Scene Reference Scanner**: Find every single `GameObject` in your scenes that holds a reference to a selected `ScriptableObject`.

## üéÆ Usage & Configuration

### Opening the Manager
You can open the main window via the Unity menu: `Tools > ScriptableObject Manager`.

### Interface Overview
The interface is designed for efficiency with three resizable panels: the category/filter list on the left, the asset list in the center, and the details/preview panel on the right.

### Core Workflow

#### üîç Searching & Filtering
Quickly narrow down your assets using the powerful filtering tools at the top of the asset list.

- **Text Search**: Type in the search box to filter assets by name in real-time.
- **Type Filter**: Use the dropdown to show only assets of a specific `ScriptableObject` type.
- **View Toggles**: Instantly switch between showing **All** assets, only your **Favorites (‚≠ê)**, or **Recently Modified** assets.

#### üñ±Ô∏è Working with Assets
Interacting with assets is fast and intuitive. Here is a quick reference guide:

| Action | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Single Click** | Selects an asset and shows its details in the right panel. |
| **Double Click** | Pings the asset in the Project window, instantly locating it. |
| **Right Click** | Opens a context menu for powerful batch operations. |
| **Drag & Drop** | Drag one or more assets directly into Inspector fields or scenes. |
| **Star Icon (‚≠ê)** | Toggles the favorite status for an asset. |
| **`Ctrl` + `Click`** | Select or deselect multiple assets for batch operations. |

### Advanced Analysis Tools

#### üîó Dependency & Reference Analysis
Select any `ScriptableObject` to see a complete breakdown of its relationships in the right-hand panel. This is essential for safe refactoring and understanding your project's architecture.

- **Uses (Dependencies)**: Lists all assets that the selected object depends on.
- **Used By (Referencers)**: Shows all other assets that reference the selected object.
- **Scene References**: Lists the specific `GameObjects` in your scenes that use this asset.

####  Scene Scanning
To find references within a specific scene, simply click the **magnifying glass icon (üîç)** next to a scene in the "Scene References" list. The tool will scan the scene and display the exact `GameObjects` using your asset.

<br>

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Access the settings by clicking the **gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è)** in the top-right corner of the window.

Here you can configure paths to be excluded from the scan, which is useful for ignoring third-party assets or plugin folders.

**Default Excluded Paths:**
```csharp
Assets/Plugins/
Packages/
```
